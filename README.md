<br>


<br>



**Author List (in no particular order):** [Elias Castro Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehcastroh/), [Rajarathnam Balakrishnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajarathnam-balakrishnan-7b447b135/), [Ikhlaq Sidhu](https://ikhlaq-sidhu.com/), [Debbie Yuen](http://www.debbiecyuen.me/), and [Alexander Fred-Ojala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderfo/) 

**About (TL/DR):** Tensorflow (TF) is an open-source library used for dataflow, differentiable programming, symbolic math ,and machine learning applications such as deep learning neural networks. TF's flexible architecture allows for easy deployment across varied processing platforms. 

**Learning Goal(s):** This notebook covers advanced topics in machine learning. However, it does not require any prior knowledge in machine learning. The goal of this notebook is to teach a user how to deploy a TF model, as well as to provide the user guidance on how to tackle the more nuanced topics. 

**Associated Materials:** To ease the learning curve, we encourage the user of this notebook to view the resources section on the main JupyterLab, and/or review the [Data-X Fundamentals](https://github.com/scetx/datax/tree/master/01-data-x-fundamentals) repo.

**Keywords (Tags):** tensorflow, tensor-flow, tensorflow-tutorial, deep-learning, deep-learning-with-python, neural-networks, data-x, uc-berkeley-engineering 

**Prerequisite Knowledge:** (1) Python, (2) NumPy, (3) Pandas, (4) Linear Algebra, (5) Bash 

**Target User:** Data scientists, applied machine learning engineers, and developers
