**About (TL/DR):** TODO TODO

**Learning Goal(s):** The goal of this series of notebooks is to provide users with the necessary foundations for building and undertanding current state of the art visualizations. An additional aim is to provide users with an understanding of both the theory and techniques of various visualization paradigms. Finally, this series of notebooks seeks to provide sufficient knowledge to users so that they may build & evaluate various visualization systems, read & discuss visualization literature, and successfully convey visual information.

**Associated Materials:** None

**Keywords (Tags):** data-visualization, matplotlib, matplotlib-tutorial, seaborn, seaborn-tutorial, visualizations, visual-storytelling, data-x, uc-berkeley-engineering 

**Prerequisite Knowledge:** (1) Python, (2) Pandas
